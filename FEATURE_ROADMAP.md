#### 1. Save/Load Custom Screens üíæ
**Status:** Not Implemented  
**User Value:** High  
**Complexity:** Low  
**Estimated Effort:** 2-4 hours

**Description:**  
Allow users to save their filter configurations and load them later. This significantly improves user experience by eliminating repetitive filter setup.

**Implementation Details:**
- Save current filter state to localStorage
- Name and describe saved screens
- List all saved screens in a dropdown/modal
- Load saved screen with one click
- Edit/delete saved screens
- Export/import screens as JSON files

**Technical Approach:**
```javascript
// Example structure
{
  savedScreens: [
    {
      id: 'screen_001',
      name: 'Growth Stocks',
      description: 'High ROE tech stocks',
      filters: {
        minROE: 20,
        sector: 'Technology',
        minMarketCap: 'mid'
      },
      createdAt: '2024-01-15',
      lastUsed: '2024-01-20'
    }
  ]
}
```

**Dependencies:**
- Existing storage-service.js module
- Similar pattern to watchlist storage

**User Stories:**
- As a user, I want to save my favorite screening criteria so I don't have to set them up each time
- As a power user, I want to quickly switch between different screening strategies

---

#### 2. Export Results (CSV/Excel) üìä
**Status:** Not Implemented  
**User Value:** High  
**Complexity:** Low  
**Estimated Effort:** 3-5 hours

- Include all visible columns
- Option to export all data or selected stocks
- File naming with timestamp (e.g., "stock_screener_2024-01-15.csv")
- Export metadata (filter criteria used)

**Technical Approach:**
- CSV: Use native JavaScript (no dependencies)
- Excel: Use SheetJS (xlsx) library (lightweight ~400KB)
- Generate blob and trigger download
- Include filter criteria as metadata in export

**Dependencies:**
- Optional: SheetJS library for Excel export
- CSV can be done with vanilla JS

**Libraries to Consider:**
- [SheetJS (xlsx)](https://github.com/SheetJS/sheetjs) - Excel export

- localStorage for alert rules storage

**Challenges:**
- Browser notifications require user permission
- Background monitoring limited in browsers (not like native apps)
- API rate limits for frequent polling
- Email notifications require backend service
- Service worker complexity

**Dependencies:**
- Web Notifications API (browser support ~95%)

## Technical Considerations

### API Rate Limits (Twelve Data Free Tier)
- **Credits per day:** 800
- **Credits per minute:** 8
- **Current usage:** ~10 credits per page load (10 stocks)

**Impact on New Features:**
