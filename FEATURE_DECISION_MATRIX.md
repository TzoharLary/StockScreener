# Feature Decision Matrix

Quick visual reference for feature prioritization decisions.

## Priority Legend
- **P0** = Critical, implement first (1-2 weeks)
- **P1** = High value, implement soon (2-4 weeks)
- **P2** = Nice to have, implement later (4-8 weeks)
- **P3** = Low priority, future consideration (8+ weeks)

## Implementation Strategy

### ✅ Phase 1: Quick Wins (Highest ROI)
**Time:** 1-2 weeks | **Effort:** 12-15 hours

| Feature | Effort | Value | Why Now? |
|---------|--------|-------|----------|
| Save/Load Custom Screens | 2-4h | High | Users constantly re-enter filters |
| Export CSV/Excel | 3-5h | High | Enable further analysis |
| Dark Mode | 4-6h | Med-High | Modern UX expectation |

**Impact:** Maximum user satisfaction with minimal effort

### 📊 Phase 2: Analytics Enhancement
**Time:** 2-4 weeks | **Effort:** 8-16 hours

| Feature | Effort | Value | Why Now? |
|---------|--------|-------|----------|
| Historical Charts | 8-16h | High | Visual insights drive decisions |

**Impact:** Transforms app from filter tool to analysis platform

### 🔔 Phase 3: Engagement Boost
**Time:** 4-8 weeks | **Effort:** 18-30 hours

| Feature | Effort | Value | Why Later? |
|---------|--------|-------|----------|
| Notifications/Alerts | 12-20h | Med-High | Complex, needs API planning |
| Latest News | 6-10h | Medium | May need additional API service |

**Impact:** Increases user retention and daily engagement

### 🌍 Phase 4: Future Vision
**Time:** 8+ weeks | **Effort:** 46-80 hours

| Feature | Effort | Value | Why Later? |
|---------|--------|-------|----------|
| Multi-language | 16-30h | Low-Med | High effort, uncertain ROI |
| Portfolio Tracking | 30-50h | High | Essentially separate product |

**Impact:** Market expansion or major version upgrade

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk (Green Light 🟢)
Safe to implement without major concerns

- ✅ Save/Load Custom Screens - localStorage, no API, no deps
- ✅ Export CSV - vanilla JS, no deps
- ✅ Dark Mode - CSS only, no deps

### Medium Risk (Proceed with Caution 🟡)
Requires planning and resource consideration

- 📊 Charts - API credits, bundle size (+50-200KB)
- 📊 Export Excel - Optional library (+400KB)
- 📰 News - May need additional API service

### High Risk (Requires Careful Planning 🔴)
Significant technical or business challenges

- 🔔 Notifications - Browser limitations, API rate limits
- 🌍 Multi-language - Maintenance burden, translation costs
- 💼 Portfolio - Very high complexity, security concerns

## API Credit Impact

Current usage: ~10 credits per page load

| Feature | Credits per Use | Cache Strategy | Risk Level |
|---------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| Current (10 stocks) | 10 | 5 min | ✅ Low |
| Charts (per stock) | 1-2 | 24 hours | ⚠️ Medium |
| News (per stock) | 1 | 4-6 hours | ⚠️ Medium |
| Alerts (polling) | Varies | Smart polling | 🔴 High |

**Free Tier Limits:**
- 800 credits/day
- 8 credits/minute

**Recommendations:**
1. Implement aggressive caching for charts and news
2. Use lazy loading (fetch only when user requests)
3. Consider upgrade to paid tier before Phase 3
4. Monitor credit usage dashboard

## Bundle Size Impact

Current: ~50KB JS (very lean)

| Feature | Library | Size | Impact |
|---------|---------|------|--------|
| Save/Load | Native JS | 0KB | ✅ None |
| CSV Export | Native JS | 0KB | ✅ None |
| Dark Mode | CSS only | 0KB | ✅ None |
| Excel Export | SheetJS | +400KB | ⚠️ Medium |
| Charts (Chart.js) | Chart.js | +200KB | ⚠️ Medium |
| Charts (Lightweight) | Lightweight Charts | +50KB | ✅ Low |
| Multi-language | i18next | +50KB | ✅ Low |

**Recommendations:**
1. Use Lightweight Charts instead of Chart.js
2. Make Excel export optional (start with CSV)
3. Use code splitting for heavy features
4. Implement lazy loading

## Browser Support Impact

All proposed features have 95%+ support in modern browsers

| Feature | Min Support | IE11? | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|-------|
| localStorage | 98% | ✅ Yes | Already in use |
| CSS Custom Props | 97% | ❌ No | Already required |
| Web Notifications | 95% | ❌ No | Requires permission |
| Service Workers | 95% | ❌ No | For alerts |
| Intl API | 97% | Partial | For i18n |

**Note:** IE11 already not supported (current implementation uses modern JS)

## User Impact Score

Score = User Value × Frequency of Use ÷ Complexity

| Feature | User Value | Frequency | Complexity | Score | Priority |
|---------|-----------|-----------|------------|-------|----------|
| Save/Load Screens | 10 | 10 | 2 | **50** | P0 🥇 |
| Export CSV/Excel | 10 | 8 | 2 | **40** | P0 🥈 |
| Dark Mode | 8 | 10 | 2 | **40** | P1 🥉 |
| Charts | 9 | 7 | 5 | **12.6** | P1 |
| Alerts | 8 | 5 | 8 | **5** | P2 |
| News | 7 | 6 | 5 | **8.4** | P2 |
| Multi-language | 4 | 8 | 8 | **4** | P3 |
| Portfolio | 10 | 9 | 10 | **9** | P3 |

## Quick Decision Tree

```
Is the feature already implemented?
│
├─ Yes → Mark as ✅ (Multiple Filters, Watchlist, Responsive Design)

└─ No → Continue...
    │
    Does it solve a frequent user pain point?
    │
    ├─ Yes → Is complexity LOW?
    │   │
    │   ├─ Yes → P0 (Save/Load, Export, Dark Mode)
    │   │
    │   └─ No → Is complexity MEDIUM?
    │       │
    │       ├─ Yes → P1 (Charts)
    │       │
    │       └─ No → P2 (Alerts)
    │
    └─ No → Is it a "nice to have"?
        │
        ├─ Yes → P2 (News)
        │
        └─ No → P3 (Multi-language, Portfolio)
```

## Recommendations Summary

### ✅ DO THIS FIRST (Next 2 weeks)
1. Save/Load Custom Screens
2. Export Results (CSV)
3. Dark Mode Toggle

**Why:** Highest impact, lowest effort, no external dependencies

### 📊 DO THIS NEXT (Within 1-2 months)
4. Export Results (Excel format) - optional enhancement
5. Historical Price Charts

**Why:** High value, manageable complexity, plan API usage

### 🤔 CONSIDER CAREFULLY (2-3 months)
6. Notifications/Alerts
7. Latest News

**Why:** Requires careful API planning, may need additional services

### ⏸️ DEFER OR RECONSIDER (6+ months)
8. Multi-language Support
9. Portfolio Tracking

**Why:** High effort, uncertain ROI, or very high complexity

## Success Criteria

After Phase 1 (Save/Load, Export, Dark Mode):
- ✅ 50%+ users save at least one screen
- ✅ 30%+ users export results
- ✅ 40%+ users enable dark mode
- ✅ No increase in API credit usage
- ✅ Bundle size stays under 100KB

If these targets are met → Proceed to Phase 2
