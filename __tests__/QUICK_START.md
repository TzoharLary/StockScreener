# Quick Start Guide - Running Tests

This guide helps you quickly get started with the StockScreener test suite.

## Prerequisites

‚úÖ Node.js installed (v14 or higher)  
‚úÖ npm installed  
‚úÖ Internet connection (for API tests)

## Installation

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd StockScreener

# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install
```

## Running Tests

### Option 1: Quick Validation (Recommended First)

Run a subset of tests to verify everything is working (5-10 minutes):

```bash
./quick-test.sh
```

This runs:
- Initialization tests (no API calls)
- Fallback data tests (no API calls)
- One API connectivity test
- Cache behavior test

**Expected Output:**
```
=========================================
StockScreener - Quick API Test Runner
=========================================

1. Testing service initialization...
‚úì should initialize with correct configuration (3 ms)
‚úì should have empty cache on initialization (1 ms)

2. Testing fallback data...
‚úì should provide fallback data for known symbols (10 ms)
‚úì should provide generic fallback for unknown symbols (3 ms)

3. Testing API connectivity with AAPL...
‚úì should fetch complete data for AAPL (8023 ms)

4. Testing cache behavior...
‚úì should respect cache (15 ms)

=========================================
Quick tests completed!
=========================================
```

### Option 2: Full Test Suite

Run all 80+ tests (30-60 minutes due to API rate limiting):

```bash
npm test
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** This makes many API calls. The free tier has a limit of 800 calls/day.

### Option 3: Specific Test Files

Run tests for a specific category:

```bash
# API endpoint tests only
npm test api-service.test.js

# Integration tests only
npm test search-display.test.js

# Edge case tests only
npm test edge-cases.test.js
```

### Option 4: Specific Test Patterns

Run tests matching a specific name:

```bash
# Run only initialization tests
npm test -- --testNamePattern="Service Initialization"

# Run only fallback tests
npm test -- --testNamePattern="Fallback Data"

# Run only AAPL tests
npm test -- --testNamePattern="AAPL"
```

## Understanding Test Output

### Success ‚úÖ

```
PASS __tests__/api-service.test.js
  ‚úì should fetch complete data for AAPL (8023 ms)

AAPL Data: {
  "symbol": "AAPL",
  "name": "Apple Inc.",
  "price": 175.43,
  "marketCap": 2800000000000,
  "peRatio": 28.5,
  ...
}

Test Suites: 1 passed
Tests: 1 passed
```

### Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è

```
console.warn
  ‚ö† WARNING: P/B Ratio is 0 for AAPL
```

This is logged but doesn't fail the test. Some zeros may be valid.

### Failure ‚ùå

```
FAIL __tests__/api-service.test.js
  ‚úï should fetch complete data for AAPL

  ‚ùå CRITICAL: All main fields are 0 for AAPL
  This indicates API is not returning proper data!
```

This indicates a real problem (likely API rate limit or connectivity issue).

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Rate limit exceeded"

**Cause:** You've made too many API calls (limit: 8/min, 800/day)

**Solution:**
- Wait a few minutes and try again
- Use the quick test script instead of full suite
- Run specific tests instead of all tests

### Issue: "All values are 0"

**Cause:** API is rate limited or not responding properly

**Solution:**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the API key is valid
- Wait a few minutes and retry
- Tests will automatically use fallback data

### Issue: "Tests take too long"

**Cause:** Tests include 8-second delays to respect API rate limits

**Solution:**
- This is expected behavior
- Use quick test script for faster validation
- Run specific test files instead of full suite

### Issue: "Cannot find module"

**Cause:** Dependencies not installed

**Solution:**
```bash
npm install
```

## Test Statistics

| Category | Test Count | Estimated Time |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Service Initialization | 2 | < 1 second |
| Default Stocks API | 10 | 80 seconds (with delays) |
| Additional Stocks API | 10 | 80 seconds (with delays) |
| Individual Statistics | 9 | 80 seconds (with delays) |
| Search Tests | 3 | 25 seconds (with delays) |
| Edge Cases | 7 | 60 seconds (with delays) |
| Integration Tests | 15+ | 120+ seconds (with delays) |
| Fallback/Cache Tests | 10 | < 5 seconds (no API) |
| **Total** | **80+** | **30-60 minutes** |

## What Each Test File Does

### `api-service.test.js`
Tests the core API service:
- Initialization
- Fetching data for all companies
- Validating all statistics
- Search functionality
- Cache management

### `search-display.test.js`
Tests the complete user flow:
- Searching for companies
- Selecting from results
- Displaying all data correctly
- Detecting zero values
- Data completeness

### `edge-cases.test.js`
Tests error scenarios:
- Invalid symbols
- Network failures
- Rate limiting
- Missing data
- Fallback behavior

## Next Steps

After running tests:

1. **Review Output** - Check console logs for warnings
2. **Check Coverage** - Run `npm run test:coverage` to see coverage report
3. **Document Results** - Use `__tests__/TEST_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md` to track findings
4. **Report Issues** - If tests fail, check the issue tracker

## Additional Resources

- **Detailed Documentation:** `__tests__/README.md`
- **Implementation Summary:** `__tests__/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- **Test Report Template:** `__tests__/TEST_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md`
- **Main README:** `README.md` (Testing section)

## Tips

üí° **Best Practice:** Start with the quick test script to verify setup, then run specific test files as needed.

üí° **Development:** Use `npm run test:watch` to automatically re-run tests as you make changes.

üí° **CI/CD:** Consider running only the quick tests in CI to avoid rate limits.

üí° **API Key:** Tests use the hardcoded API key from the issue. For production, use environment variables.

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the console output for specific error messages
2. Review `__tests__/README.md` for detailed documentation
3. Check if the API is operational: https://twelvedata.com/status
4. Verify your API key is valid and has available credits
